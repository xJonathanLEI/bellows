**Durable task processing framework in Rust for applications of all sizes**

## Built-in backends

`bellows` currently ships with:

- an in-memory backend for lightweight testing; and
- a SQLite backend for durable local development and single-process deployment scenarios.

### SQLite signaling model

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The SQLite backend **ONLY** supports single-process deployment.

The SQLite backend persists tasks durably, but SQLite does not provide a native notification mechanism that can wake dispatchers in other processes.

Because of that, the built-in SQLite backend uses an in-process signal channel. Clones of the same `SqliteBackend` instance receive new-task notifications immediately, but separate processes sharing the same database file do not.

That means the SQLite backend is appropriate for local development, tests, and same-process worker setups, but it should not be treated as a distributed production backend.

A planned future extension will allow the in-memory signaling to be swapped out to something like Redis to support the multi-process deployment model.
